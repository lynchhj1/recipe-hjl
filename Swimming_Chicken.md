# Swimming Chicken

Swimming chicken is seared chicken pieces that are baked in a lemon/oil/garlic sauce. My parents used to start a version of this and go swimming for an hour.

## Sauce Ingredients

|Ingredient|Amount|Other|
|:---|:---|:---|
| Olive oil | 1 Cup | |
| Lemon Juice | 1.25 to 1.5 Cups | |
| Garlic | 0.5 to 1 head of garlic | |

It is helpful to microwave and roll lemons before squeezing them.

Squeeze enough lemons to get about 1.5 cups of juice. Add 1 cup of olive oil. Slice or press garlic and stir it into the sauce.

## Chicken Ingredients

Dry chicken pieces and then generously season all sides with Tony Chachere's.

## Required Tools

- 8 to 12 Inch Cast Iron Skillet 
- Citrus juicer
- Deep Sheet Pan
- Aluminum Foil

## Preperation

1. Prepare sauce.
2. Prepare chicken.
3. Put two layers of foil into the sheet pan.
4. Heat dry cast iron skillet over medium heat.
5. Add 2-3 chicken pieces skin side down first for about 4 minutes a side. When pieces are done place skin side down in the sheet pan.  This helps them to prevent sticking to the foil.
6. Set oven to 375 degrees.
7. After the chicken has all been cooked, set the heat to low/simmer and deglaze the cast iron skillet some of the sauce and a metal spoon or spatula. Once you have removed enough of the food bits from the skillet add the rest of the sauce to get some color.
8. Turn off the heat to the cast iron.
9. Pour half of the sauce onto the chicken and reserve the rest.
10. Bake chicken for 30 minutes, remove from oven, flip all the pieces, add the rest of the sauce and return to the oven.
11. Bake for 30 more minutes and remove from oven.
12. Serve over chicken rice-a-roni with plenty of sauce spooned on top.
